- To test things locally checkout the "tus_support" branch in the crm, then browse to 192.168.33.2:8080/demos/image-manipulation/resize-to-75x75.
  - You should have drag/drop areas and file preview areas in that demo. The demo is also set to be resumable.
  - You need to run the tus_support branch in the API locally:
    `tlsvc -s tusd start` (I have had problems locally starting it recently: tla:Services Service 'tusd' dead according ps pattern '(bin/|^)tusd' with no matches.  +124ms) This needs investigation ...
    `tlsvc -s haproxy start`
    `node api2/bin/server`
    and in a separate panel `node api2/bin/worker`

  - Then you can select some files or drag/drop them, start the upload and interrupt your internet connection.
    Then put it back in and see if the files resume uploading and the progress bar acts accordingly.
  - Posting to your local vbox.transloadit.com might be too fast. You may need to select large files to test things. :/
    I will soon push the api2 tus_support branch to production so we can test this better.

- You can do "npm run dev" after changes that you want to test. That will build the project and move the built files into the crm repo. Just refresh that demo page then
  and it should run on the newest version. :)

KNOWN ISSUES:

- [x] on reconnect when resumable is false and uploading was not finished, the old assembly object should be cleaned up and removed and a new one created.
- [x] `onExecuting` is not triggered?
- [x] Test uploaded bytes in resumable files (Marius' work) // resumable: true fires upload meta data extracted too early
- [x] resumable:true with requireUploadMetaData:false does not upload to test, because it ends too soon (onSuccess and therefore reset are called too soon)
- [x] add socket.io via npm
- [x] Do not show tus error message on disconnect; just show the disconnect error
- [x] Uploading 100MB file over tus consistently stops/breaks at 50% upload
- [x] Figure out how we can do i18n better so that people can add their own translations without having to be stuck on a custom build

For later:
- [x] we need some automated tests
- [ ] when there is no file upload the jQuery plugin should not say "uploading files"
- [ ] If we go offline when upload is at 100% and then reconnect, make sure to show progress bar again at 100%
  - Generally the progress bar starts somewhere else after a reconnect, because we rely on client side progress events, not on server side ones
- [x] Problem with reconnects when resumable: true - we are missing out on progress events sometimes -> Marius says this cannot be bypassed
- [x] I cannot start tusd locally for some reason which naturally results in "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://vbox.transloadit.com/resumable/" errors in the browser.
- [ ] it would be nice to have little preview images for images or videos in the file preview areas and otherwise icons for the file types
