- To test things locally checkout the "tus_support" branch in the crm, then browse to 192.168.33.2:8080/demos/image-manipulation/resize-to-75x75.
  - You should have drag/drop areas and file preview areas in that demo. The demo is also set to be resumable.
  - You need to run the tus_support branch in the API locally:
    `tlsvc -s tusd start` (I have had problems locally starting it recently: tla:Services Service 'tusd' dead according ps pattern '(bin/|^)tusd' with no matches.  +124ms) This needs investigation ...
    `tlsvc -s haproxy start`
    `node api2/bin/server`
    and in a separate panel `node api2/bin/worker`

  - Then you can select some files or drag/drop them, start the upload and interrupt your internet connection.
    Then put it back in and see if the files resume uploading and the progress bar acts accordingly.
  - Posting to your local vbox.transloadit.com might be too fast. You may need to select large files to test things. :/
    I will soon push the api2 tus_support branch to production so we can test this better.

- You can do "npm run dev" after changes that you want to test. That will build the project and move the built files into the crm repo. Just refresh that demo page then
  and it should run on the newest version. :)

- we need to test locally if the resuming works at all
  -> check for the resumable case in this._onReconnect()

- it would be nice to have little preview images for images or videos in the file preview areas
- and otherwise icons for the file types
- we need some automated tests
- [ ] when there is no file upload the jQuery plugin should not say "uploading files"

KNOWN ISSUES:

- I cannot start tusd locally for some reason which naturally results in "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://vbox.transloadit.com/resumable/" errors in the browser.
